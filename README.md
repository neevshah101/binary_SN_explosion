The code for the binary evolution and kicks is in ```binary_orbit_evolution.py``` which can also be accessed from the command line. Clone the repository, and then enter the folder named ```cd binary_SN_explosion```. Now run ```python binary_robit_evolution.py``` in the terminal. This will use the default configuration, and generate two ```.gif``` animations. One is for the orbit as aseen from an inertial frame and the seocnd one is for the orbit as seen in the center of mass frame. To see all available configuration options that can be currently modified, run  ```python binary_orbit_evolution.py --help```
